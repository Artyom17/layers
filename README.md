# Multi-layers in WebXR

A feature repo for working on multi-layer support in WebXR

This is a feature repo (as defined in the proposals process) that has been created for exploring multi-layer graphics for XR.

The conversation that led to the creation of this repo can be found in [Proposals Issues #46](https://github.com/immersive-web/proposals/issues/46).

Artem Bolgar (@Artyom17) is coordinating the creation of the initial explainers.
